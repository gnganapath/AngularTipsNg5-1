how to do angular cli install behind corporate proxy
---------------------------------------------------
step: 0:

By default : once installed Node Js without comparny proxy it will set npm registry.
If you want to set global npm regristry follow the step. But out case start from Step:1

C:\windows\system32>ping proxy                                                                                                                          

Step 3

You will find proxy URL of your work environment very similar to the below proxy URL format in the first line,

step:4

npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
